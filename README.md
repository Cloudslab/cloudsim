# CloudSim: A Framework For Modeling And Simulation Of Cloud Computing Infrastructures And Services #

Cloud Computing is the leading approach for delivering reliable, secure, fault-tolerant, sustainable, and scalable computational services. Hence timely, repeatable, and controllable methodologies for performance evaluation of new cloud applications and policies before their actual development are required. Because utilization of real testbeds limits the experiments to the scale of the testbed and makes the reproduction of results an extremely difficult undertaking, simulation may be used.

CloudSim's goal is to provide a generalized and extensible simulation framework that enables modeling, simulation, and experimentation of emerging Cloud Computing infrastructures and application services, allowing its users to focus on specific system design issues that they want to investigate, without getting concerned about the low level details related to Cloud-Based infrastructures and services.

CloudSim is developed in [the Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Laboratory](http://cloudbus.org/), at [the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department](http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/) of [the University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/).

More information can be found on the [CloudSim's web site](http://cloudbus.org/cloudsim/).
